# Express Assessment: User Management API

In this assessment, you will be making a minor User management API. Most of the files and database is set up for you. You just need to create the routes in the `routes/user.js` file.

When you want to check, there are 2 ways you can run the server.

- `npm run start` or `npm start`
- `npm run test` to run the jest test suite
